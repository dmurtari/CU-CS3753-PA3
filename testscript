ITERATIONS=100000000
MIXITERATIONS=1000
BYTESTOCOPY=102400
BLOCKSIZE=1024
TIMEFORMAT="wall=%e user=%U system=%S CPU=%P i-switched=%c v-switched=%w"
MAKE="make -s"

# wall is wall clock time
# user is time spent in user time
# system is system time used
# CPU is CPU usage
# i-switched is number of times involuntarily i-switched
# v-switched is when program voluntarily gives up time
